Sample Python Codes for PiCar-X 

This repository includes the following sample Python codes for PiCar-X Tech Robot. It also includes general information about the device and its operation.

The sample codes include:

- Background_Music.py
  You can add this piece of code to your script to enjoy listening to music during running the car.
  
- Grayscale_Sensor.py
 This code can activate the Grayscale Sensor. The three-channel grayscale module integrated into PiCar-X prevents the car from falling off the cliff when it moves freely. It can   also be used for implementing running along the line.
 
- Move_Camera.py
  This code shows how you can move the camera in different directions. 

- Move_Wheels.py
  You can manage the movement of the wheels. Four wheels with powerful motors have flexibility on the back and forth movements, and also 360° turning.

- Obstacle_Avoidance.py
 This code can be used to measure the distance between the PiCar and obstacles for taking proper action before the conflict.
 
- Sound_Effect.py
  It can be used for making your desired sound effect.
  
- Text_to_Speech.py
  This code converts text into voice, and you can hear the voice from the PiCar.

PiCar-X Operation Instructions:

1.	Connect your PC to the WIFI connection that has already been configured on the Raspberry Pi of all available PiCar-X robots. 
   You will be advised about the relevant WIFI name and password.

2.	Download and install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) on your PC by using the following link if you have not already done so: https://code.visualstudio.com/
   You may also prefer to use other code editors such as PyCharm, but in this case, you have to do the SSH configuration by yourself.

3. In the search box of VS Code, search for and install the Remote-SSH extension, which is used for connecting your PC to SSH hosts. 
   You can also search for and install Python3 using the box if you have not already installed Python3 on your PC. 
 
4.	Switch on your PiCar-X. You will hear a voice telling you the IP address of the device. Take a note of it. 

5.	Write down the IP address in the SSH Target box.

6.	Enter the SSH password, which is told by your PiCar-X.

8.	It is done. You should be connected to the device now.

9.	Now you can create your Python file in CS Code editor and run the Python code on your PiCar.
